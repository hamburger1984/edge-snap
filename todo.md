## Design

* Create favicon and logos:
    Please invent a logo for this. Use it in the title of the App and in favicon. Maybe create a base version as svg and derive pngs and ico from that. Link apropriate variants from the manifest as well.


## Behavior

* When creating a new project, remove the edge overlay.
* When navigating in between images in a series on the main screen, always update the edge to take the selected images edges.
* When resizing the window, update the edge rendering to match the new image size.
* When snapping images for a new project, the view of photos in this series is not updated properly.
* When snapping an image on mobile or a small browser window, the page gets scrolled to the film-strip.
* When in mobile landscape mode, the edge overlay is not properly aligned with the preview until an new image is captured.
* The camera selector is taking too much space. Reduce the size of the camera selector and make it more compact.

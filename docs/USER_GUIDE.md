## Advanced Photography Techniques

### Stop-Motion Animation

Create smooth animations by taking many photos with small movements:

**Planning Your Animation:**
1. **Set up your scene** with good, consistent lighting
2. **Take your first frame** as a reference
3. **Make tiny movements** to your subject (1-2mm between frames)
4. **Use edge detection** to keep camera position consistent
5. **Capture 12-24 frames** for each second of final animation

**Animation Tips:**
- **Smaller movements = smoother animation**
- **Consistent lighting** prevents flickering
- **Plan your sequence** before starting
- **Use the edge overlay** to maintain perfect camera alignment

### Document Scanning

EdgeSnap excels at capturing document series with perfect alignment:

**Document Setup:**
1. **Stable surface**: Place documents on a flat, well-lit surface
2. **Consistent positioning**: Use edge detection to maintain framing
3. **Good lighting**: Avoid shadows and glare
4. **High contrast**: Ensure text is clearly readable

### Time-Lapse Photography

Capture changes over time with consistent framing:

**Time-Lapse Tips:**
- **Fixed camera position**: Use edge detection for alignment
- **Regular intervals**: Take photos at consistent time intervals
- **Weather considerations**: Plan for changing light conditions
- **Long-term projects**: Create separate projects for different time periods

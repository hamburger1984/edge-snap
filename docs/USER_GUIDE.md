### Camera Setup

#### Selecting a Camera
- Use the camera dropdown in the top toolbar
- Front cameras are ideal for selfies and vlogs

#### Choosing Resolution
- **HD (720p)**: Basic quality, faster processing
- **Full HD (1080p)**: Standard quality for most uses
- **QHD (1440p)**: Recommended default - good balance of quality and performance
- **4K (2160p)**: High quality for professional work

## Best Practices

### Planning Your Project
1. **Storyboard** your sequence before starting
2. **Test lighting** and camera position
3. **Practice movements** before recording
4. **Plan for mistakes** - you can always retake frames

### Technical Best Practices
1. **Stable surface**: Mount your device or use a tripod
2. **Consistent lighting**: Avoid changing light conditions
3. **Battery life**: Ensure device is charged for long sessions
4. **Regular saves**: Projects auto-save, but create backups of important work

### Creative Tips
1. **Start simple**: Master basic movements before complex animations
2. **Reference real motion**: Study how things actually move
3. **Exaggerate**: Slightly exaggerated movements often look more natural
4. **Sound planning**: Think about adding sound/music to your sequences later
